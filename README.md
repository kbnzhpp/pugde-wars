-- PUDGE WARS GAME --

This is game based on dota 2 custom mode

To start game with friend one of you need to oper server.exe, then start game on 'localhost' ip. Others should copy his ip(I recommend to use Radmin VPN) and paste it game. 

Game goes until one of teams get 50 kills, then game restarts on all pcs, server restars on pc with server.exe opened
